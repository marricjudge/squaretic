Square Tic² is an mobile game application that builds on the simple rules of 
Tic Tac Toe and sets nine Tic Tac Toes games into a master game that has to be won.

The app is a two player game defined by the colors blue and red which alternately 
set one tile in their corresponding color on the board. The gameboard has a 3x3 matrix 
where each field contains another 3x3 matrix inside. In total the board is 81 tiles (9x9) large. 
The goal of the game is to win the individual Tic Tac Toe fields to gain a point in the overlaying 
master field. The player who first finishes the master Tac Tac Toe wins the game.

A special feature of the game is that not all nine small fields can’t be played
arbitrarily. The previous selected field influences which next field will be
selectable for the opponent. When player red in the upper left field selects the
middle right tile, then in the next turn for blue only the unplayed tiles in the
middle right field of the master board are playable. A visual explanation is to be
seen in the How To Play section below.

Square Tic² is a dynamic game that brings the simple and foreseeable structure
of Tic Tac Toe to a much more difficult level. In the classic Tic Tac Toe game
usually the first player wins and a game round is quite quick. Square Tic² solves
these issues as at most points in the game it is not clear who will win in the end.
